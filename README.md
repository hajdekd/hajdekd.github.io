## [Classification](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Dalibor_Hajdek_Classification_Labipynb.ipynb)
 
 
 **Overview**
 
The objective of the project is to through logistic regression models predict which clients will apply for a bank loan. Additionally, the aim is to determine importance of features in model building. The [Loan](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Loan_dataset.csv) dataset used for the project contains 14 variables and 5000 observations, without missing values.  
Following models are built and compared: 

* Decision Tree Without Hyperparameters
* Decision Tree With Hyperparameters
* Decision Tree With Cost Complexity Pruning

## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Dalibor_Hajdek_Linear_Regression_Assignment.ipynb)

**Overview**

The goal for the project is to provide forecast in prices of used cars in market that was impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. 
The [Used Cars](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/UsedCars.csv) dataset consists of both continuous and numerical variables.  
Techniques applied in the project are log transformation and treating outliers.

## [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Dalibor_Hajdek_Ensemble_Lab.ipynb)

**Overview**

For this project, the objective is to forecast which clients might default in paying back their loans. 
[Credit](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/credit.csv) data set is used for the exercise.   

After performing thorough EDA and data pre-processing, the following models are created:
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Bagging Classifier
* AdaBoost Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier  

Each of the models is afterwards Hyperparameter tunned. 
Predictions from multiple models are combined to seek the best predictive performance.



## [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Dalibor_Hajdek_Unsupervised_ML_Clustering_Lab.ipynb)

**Overview**

The goal of the project is to identify different types of engineering colleges (clusters) to better understand their ranks and information.  
The [data](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/colleges_dataset.xlsx) contains a survey of 26 engineering colleges.  
The survey has summarized the data into a rating scale of 1-5 for different factors. 


## [Data Visualization With Shiny App From RStudio](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Dalibor_Hajdek_Energy_Consumption.R)

**Overview**

As the global population continues to rapidly grow, keeping up with demand for energy has become primary objective for governments around the world.  
Many countries have experienced significant rise in GDP over the last several decades, mainly due to increased productivity and technological advancements.  
Using visualizations, the goal is to communicate consumption of main energy resources that include oil, gas, coal, and renewable energy on global level, and provide analysis for five countries with highest gross domestic product in the world.  
Furthermore, the analysis focuses on period from 1995 through 2015.  
[Enregy Consumption](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Energy.Consumption.csv) and [GDP and Population](https://github.com/hajdekd/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/GDP.and.Population.csv) datasets are used for the project.
